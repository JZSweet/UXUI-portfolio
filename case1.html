            <p>Through research we were seeking to answer these questions: </p>
            <p>- What are our users looking for in an app like this? </p>
            <p>- Would our users make a habit of using this app? </p>
            <p>- Would using the app help users with time management? </P>
            <P>- Do users feel that there is a need to divide household tasks?</p>

            <p>During our interview, we discovered that cleaning, organizing, and lists were all very important. But our users need something that will hold their attention as well.</p>
