                <p>At five years old, I started learning to play the violin. I liked learning new chords, techniques, and writing songs. <br>As I improved, I gained a greater understanding of the instrument as a whole. Each system perfected allows the artist
                    to play more freely and with intuition. The constraints that once made me feel bound. Now, show me multiple pathways to achieve my goals. <br>This is what it is like to code. </p>
                <p>By using coding, I can break down the overarching notion of a website or application. Organizing what may seem chaotic into easy-to-understand concepts. Which allows me a greater comprehension of the minutiae that make code work.<br>However,
                    just knowing how to code is not enough for an app to succeed. The front-end and the back-end have to work together in harmony. Finding the balance in this is the key to success in full-stack development. </p>
                <p>After becoming proficient in full-stack development. I began to consider user preferences and demand. This piqued my interest in the UX/UI side of coding.<br>The hardest part of interface design is to balance my personal preferences and
                    the needs of users. <br>Through classes, I learned how to conduct research that supports my project's direction. I am now ready to say that I feel comfortable providing a product that users will be happy with. While still retaining
                    some of my unique styles. </p>
